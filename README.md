# Psych-Engine-Wiki-Extra
An attempt at making a better LUA documentation for Friday Night Funkin': Psych Engine. The current one sucks and is very outdated, so I thought it might be worth a shot at making a community driven one.

If you spot an error, or think something should be added, please [open an issue](https://github.com/SmallSquareStudios/Psych-Engine-Wiki-Extra/issues/new/choose), it helps the wiki grow.

You can find the home page of the wiki [here](https://github.com/SmallSquareStudios/Psych-Engine-Wiki-Extra/wiki).
